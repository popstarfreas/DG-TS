## Information
Abilities will have either or both of a passive and active part. A Passive part of an ability is something that happens automatically without manual input, whilst an active part of an ability is one that requires manual input to trigger.

Manual inputs rely on a combination of movement keys. The below assumes movement keys are bound to WASD. So S S would mean press the 'S' key twice in rapid succession. For combinations such as W S, you may hold down W and tap S (multiple times even).
