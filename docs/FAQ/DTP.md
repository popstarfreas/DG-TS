> Q: How can I buy XP%?
>
> A: You can buy XP% by using the bar near the Get Crew button(or the Crew Badge if you're crew), (as of Oct 10 2019) each XP% costs 10 DP. XP% Can go past 100% leading in more XP.

> Say I have 50% XP% and I receive 500XP, the server will multiply `500 by 50% (or 0.5)` which means I only get half of it(250 XP), this formula applies no matter how much XP% whether it is 50% or 1000%.
