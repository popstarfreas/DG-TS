# Server

The server has a few Dimensions. You can join other dimensions by doing `/<dimension name>`, if you want to join Survival, you'd do `/survival` and if you want to join Build I'd do `/build` and so on. You can also join other dimensions by using the warp plates in Rift.

## Minigames

### Zombies
TShock Server, `/gamemodes` then enter the little pond below Z-O-M-B-I-E-S letter statues to join.

Zombies is the only "minigame" in the server, it involves a wave of monsters every round that you have to survive.

There are 4 types of lobbies:

Public Lobbies, are normal lobbies created by the server that anyone can join aslong as it is in the intermission period up to the 3rd round.

<a name="Hardcore-Zombies"></a>

Hardcore Zombies, hardcore zombies gives more XP and DP but, if you get hit you die instantly, HP Chests are replaced with Life Chests (buy life so you won't die instantly when you get hit), you can join hardcore zombies by doing `/j z -hc` in the gamemodes lobby.

Protected Lobbies (formerly Private Lobbies), basically a private version of the public lobby, only invited people can join. You can create a protected lobby by doing `/j z -p` in the gamemodes lobby.

Private Lobbies (formerly Custom Lobbies), a lobby you can customize, changing the arena, amount of HP, etc., they are automatically private. You can't use this type of lobby for gaining DP or XP. You can create a private lobby by doing `/j z -c` in the gamemodes lobby to join.
