# Server

The server has a few Dimensions. You can join other dimensions by doing `/<dimension name>`, if you want to join Survival, you'd do `/survival` and if you want to join Build I'd do `/build` and so on. You can also join other dimensions by using the warp plates in Rift.

## Minigames

### Zombies
TShock Server, `/gamemodes` then enter the little pond below Z-O-M-B-I-E-S letter statues to join.

Zombies is the only "minigame" in the server, it involves a wave of monsters every round that you have to survive.

There are 4 types of lobbies:

Public Lobbies, are normal lobbies created by the server that anyone can join as long as it is currently in intermission or below Round 4.

<a name="Hardcore-Zombies"></a>

Hardcore Zombies, hardcore zombies gives more XP and DP but, if you get hit you die instantly, HP Chests are replaced with Life Chests (buy life so you won't die instantly when you get hit), you can join hardcore zombies by doing `/j z -hc` in the gamemodes lobby.

Private Lobbies (formerly Protected Lobbies), basically a private version of the public lobby, only invited people can join. You can create a private lobby by doing `/j z -p` in the gamemodes lobby.

Custom Lobbies (formerly Private Lobbies), a lobby you can customize, change the arena, amount of HP, etc., they are automatically private. You can't use this type of lobby for gaining DP or XP. You can create a custom lobby by doing `/j z -c` in the gamemodes lobby to join.

> Q: How can I invite my friend?
>
> A: `/invite <your friend's name>`.

>
> A: No, only your lobbymates can see the lobby chat, anyone else in other dimensions can't.

> A: Yes, `/lobby upall` to toggle on|off, this will consume your points till the chest is maxed out or you ran out of points.

> Q: How can I give other people my points?
>
> A: Assuming both you and the player you want to give points to are alive, you can do `/lobby ts <Player> <Points>`.

> Q: What are abilities?
>
> A: Abilities are like skills.

> Q: Where can I see a list of abilities/information about abilities?
>
> A: [here](https://github.com/popstarfreas/DG-TS/wiki/Zombies-Abilities).

## TSL
Terraria Server Lite or TSL servers are similar to TShock in some ways, TSL was created by popstarfreas (Rofle) to minimize resource consumption. It is completely separate from Terraria's source code and makes no use of it (more info available at [the knowledgebase](https://github.com/popstarfreas/TerrariaServerLite-KnowledgeBase). It is currently only available on DG.

## TShock
