# Accounts

> Q: Do I need an account?
>
> A: An account is not really needed to play on [Zombies](ServernGamemodes.md#Zombies), [PvE](ServernGamemodes.md#PvE), [PvP](ServernGamemodes.md#PvP), [etc](ServernGamemodes.md), **BUT** it is required for [Survival](ServernGamemodes.md#Survival)

## Registering

> Q: How do I register?
>
> A: To register an account you **MUST** be in rift(`/rift`), do `/register <password>`, then do `/login <password>`.

> Q: `/register` says I already own an account.
>
> A: Aslong as you have logged in **ATLEAST** 1 time into your account, you can simply do `/rename <name the /register command told you>` then `/login` without password(this is of course assuming you have the same IP and Computer), but if you haven't already logged in atleast one time, do `/login <password>` instead of `/login` without a password.

> Q: `/register` says my name is already registered
>
> A: Simply do `/rename <new name>` to get another name and register again.

> Q: How do I play with another name but using the same account?
>
> A: Join the server with another name then go to `/build` and do `/login <Account Username> <Password>`. `<Account Username>` represents the name you registered with, and `<Password>` represents the password you used when registering.
>
> i.e. I registered with a character named AveryClone, and I want to play with the name BlancIsEbic, I'd simply join the server with BlancIsEbic and do `/login AveryClone MyPassword123`.

## Recovery

> Q: I forgot my password
>
> A: If you forget your password but you have logged in atleast one time, you can go to `/rift` and then do `/register <password>`, it will tell you that you already have a character named ..., simply do `/rename <name it told you>` then do `/login` with no password.

> Q: I want to change my password
>
> A: Assuming you remember your old password, you can go to `/build` and do the command `/password <old password> <new password>`
>
> i.e. My password is `123` and I want to change it to `456` I'd do `/password 123 456`
>
> A2: If you forgot your password and want to change it, you'll have to contact an admin in-game or on [Discord](http://discord.gg/ZuNQUdZ){:target="_blank"}
