# Phase
Phase is a client you can use to chat with other players without launching Terraria, it's basically Dark Gaming's Discord. The Terraria Discussion is automatically synced with the chat in-game.

> Q: Are people using Phase an admin?
>
> A: No, refer to [Staff](Staff.md) for a list of staff.

> Q: How can I get Phase?
>
> A: Getting Phase is easy, it is similar to becoming a member of DTP, you can start using Phase by logging in [here](https://phase.dark-gaming.com/){:target="_blank"}. **make SURE** Dark Gaming is selected, then login with your in-game [username and password](Accounts.md#Username-Password).

> Q: Why does Phase not work for me?
>
> A: This is a common problem, it ranges from incorrect [username or password](Accounts.md#Username-Password) to accounts that are registered recently, contact an admin if this occurs.

> Q: What is the future of Phase?
>
> A: Phase will remain in its current role, but the Discord server will eventually get a bot that relays chat there too

> Q: Why can't I see what people are saying in Zombies?
>
> A: By default, the chat in Zombies is lobby chat which only players in the same lobby can see.
